                        <p>You're hypervigilant and strategic - you track reactions, adjust tactics, know how to get what you want from people. But based on your answers, when you hurt people it's genuinely not on purpose. You're blind to causing harm even while being hyperaware of everything else.

                        <p>This could be two things: (1) Extreme dissociation is blocking access to both memory AND feelings, or (2) The wiring for remorse was never built/got shut off permanently early.</p>
